# Hashing
* A hash function is a sequence of mathematical operations that deterministically maps any arbitrary data into a defined range of values.
* A good hashing function is uniform in how it distributes the data over a range of values
* We want to be able to hash absolutely anything in order for something to be a good hashing function
* A hash function is deterministic meaning it should always produce the same value given the same input.
