# Hadoop Intro

## What is Big Data?
  * Big data is the term for a collection of data so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using hand-on database mamagement tools or traditional data processing applications.

## The 5 V's to identify a Big Data problem
  * *V*olume - processing increasing huge data sets
  * *V*ariety - Processing different types of data, i.e. music/video files, JSON, emails etc. Structured and unstructures data. Most of the data is unstructured, likes on Facebook for example, and traditional systems aren't capable of processig such a variaty of unstructured data.
  * *V*elocity - The alarming rate with which Data is being
  generated. Data is coming from many different directions, machines and GPS systems that are continuously sending informtation. Potentially were talking about millions of billions of hits per second. We need some extended capability that get withstand the velocity of that data being dumped into our traditional systems.
  * *V*alue - Finding correct meaning out of the data. How do we monetize it. Need to be able to identify the correct data-sets that will add value to the business.
